# Contributing to mint-css
Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project!

## Reporting bugs
* Check if the bug was reported previously by searching under [Issues](https://github.com/Saunved/mint-css/issues) on Github
* If the bug isn't reported please report it [here](https://github.com/Saunved/mint-css/issues/new/choose)

## Fixing bugs
* Open a new pull request and mention the issue number (if present)
* Please write a verbose description to highlight exactly what has been fixed and how

## Adding new themes
* You can create new themes under ```src/themes``` and open a pull request for the same
* You can refer to the following website to quickly create theme colors: [Colormind](http://colormind.io/template/material-dashboard/)
* Modifications for existing themes will usually not be accepted

## Adding new flavors
* You can create your own flavors under ```src``` and add your own ```partials``` and ```components```
* If you are reusing components, you can either link to them (in which case you have to ensure dependencies are maintained) or create a separate copy (in which you have to ensure that bug fixes and modifications in the original are reflected manually).
* Open a pull request when you are ready to add your flavor
* If you have an idea or you are a designer who wants to implement a flavor, please create a new flavor request [here](https://github.com/Saunved/mint-css/issues/new/choose)

## Contributing to documentation
* Still working on how to structure the documentation!
